# SneakyInventory
This application is intended to be used to log inventories of Sneaky Burger. This can only be used by the Wollongong branch for the time being

## Main Objectives:
- [ ] Show alert for stock levels with colour coded highlights
- [ ] Automatically send email to suppliers when an item is below par

## Nice-to-haves:
- [ ] User logins so application can detect the user who logged the inventory
- [ ] Referring to previous stock-levels so it would be easier to record stock levels 
- [ ] Ability for other branches to log their own stock levels 

## Current draft of application
